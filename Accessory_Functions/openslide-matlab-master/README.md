ABOUT
================
This library contains MATLAB bindings to the C library OpenSlide, 
which is used to read image data from digital whole-slide images.

INSTALLATION
================
Add the folder and any sub folders to the MATLAB path. Also download 
source code or binaries for OpenSlide from http://openslide.org/download/. 
If downloading the source, make sure to follow instructions provided by 
OpenSlide for compiling the binaries. Remember to also add the folders
of these libraries and the include files to the MATLAB path. 

If using release 3.4 or older, make sure to edit the openslide.h 
so that '#include <openslide-features.h>' reads 
'#include "openslide-features.h"' instead.

When running openslide_load_library a wrapper header file will be 
created in the openslide MATLAB repository. This file is needed 
as wrapper to avoid some issues with gcc function attributes.
